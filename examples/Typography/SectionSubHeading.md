Renders a styled `<h3>` element for denoting the heading of a new subsection within a page.

For accessibility, the `<SectionSubHeading>` should be below the corresponding `<SectionHeading>` in the DOM, and should not be ordered within other heading elements.

```jsx
<SectionSubHeading>Section Subheading</SectionSubHeading>
```
